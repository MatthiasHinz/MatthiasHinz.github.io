<KnowledgeArea NameLong="Analytical Methods" NameShort="AM" Description="This knowledge area encompasses a wide variety of operations whose objective is to derive analytical results from geospatial data. Data analysis seeks to understand both first-order (environmental) effects and second-order (interaction) effects. Approaches that are both data-driven (exploration of geospatial data) and model-driven (testing hypotheses and creating models) are included. Data driven techniques derive summary descriptions of data, evoke insights about characteristics of data, contribute to the development of research hypotheses, and lead to the derivation of analytical results. The goal of model-driven analysis is to create and test geospatial process models. In general, model-driven analysis is an advanced knowledge area where previous experience with exploratory spatial data analysis would constitute a desired prerequisite. Visual tools for data analysis are covered in Knowledge Area CV Cartography and Visualization and many of the fundamental principles required to ground data analysis techniques are introduced in Knowledge Area CF Conceptual Foundations. Image processing techniques are considered in Knowledge Area GD Geospatial Data. All of the methods described in this knowledge area are more or less sensitive to data error and uncertainty as covered in Unit GC8 Uncertainty and Unit GD6 Data quality. Mastery of the educational objectives outlined in this knowledge area requires knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics, and computer programming.">

</KnowledgeArea>
<KnowledgeArea NameLong="Conceptual Foundations" NameShort="CF" Description="The GIScience perspective is grounded in spatial thinking. The aim of this knowledge area is to recognize, identify, and appreciate the explicit spatial, spatio-temporal and semantic components of the geographic environment at an ontological and epistemological level in preparation for modeling the environment with geographic data and analysis. In order to do this, one must understand the nature of space and time as a context for geographic phenomena. This knowledge area covers the ways in which views of the geographic environment depend on philosophical viewpoints, physics, human cognition, society, and the task at hand. This knowledge area also requires an understanding of the fundamental principles in the discipline of geography, the language of spatial tasks. On a more advanced level, this area incorporates mathematical and graphical models that formalize these concepts, such as set theory, algebra, and semantic nets.  Because of its wide range of foundational principles, this knowledge area forms a basis for the other knowledge areas. Wise design and use of geospatial technologies requires an understanding of the nature of geographic information, the social and philosophical context of geographic information, and the principles of geography. This knowledge area is especially closely tied to Knowledge Areas DM Data Modeling and DA Design Aspects, as generic data models (such as raster and vector) and application designs need to be grounded in sound conceptual models. The foundations of geographic information have developed over several decades. Philosophical and scientific views on the nature of space and time have evolved since the ancient Greeks. Early papers during the quantitative revolution, such as Berry (1964), began to formalize the structure of information used in geographic inquiry. The fundamental data structures and algorithms comprising the GIS software developed in the 1960s and 1970s were based on implicit common-sense conceptual models of geographic information. During the 1980s, several researchers questioned these underlying assumptions. Some were refuted, other confirmed, and many extended. However, the most rapid pace of development in this area was during the 1990s with the rise of GIScience as a distinct discipline, and the many cooperative initiatives it comprised. The new millennium has seen some of these foundational principles incorporated into commercial software, thus making theoretical knowledge even more important for practitioners.  It is expected that the concepts in this knowledge area will be learned gradually. An introductory course would cover only a few topics in a cursory manner, an intermediate course on data modeling or data analysis would cover several theoretical topics of practical application, and a number of graduate courses could cover each topic in a research-oriented environment. Discussion of this knowledge area includes several terms that can have multiple meanings. For the purposes of this document, two in particular require definition: 1. Geographic: Almost any subject or discourse involving earthly phenomena, studied from a spatial perspective at a medium scale (sub-astronomical and super-architectural). 2. Phenomenon: Any subject of geographic discourse that is perceived to be external to the individual, including entities, events, processes, social constructs, and the like.">
<Unit NameLong="Philosophical foundations" NameShort="CF1" Description="Many branches of philosophy are relevant to an understanding of geographic information, especially metaphysics and epistemology. Researchers and practitioners of GIS AND T have followed (explicitly or unknowingly) several different philosophical approaches to understanding the nature of our work, which influences our structuring, analysis, and interpretation of geographic information. It is, therefore, crucial for professionals to understand these principles in order to bridge (rather than eliminate) the differences and work together.

While the mathematical principle of homomorphism (often operationalized as fitness for use) allows for imperfect data to be useful as long as they yield results adequate for the use for which they are intended, imperfections are frequently problematic. Although terminology still varies, two types of imperfection are generally accepted: vagueness (a.k.a. fuzziness, imprecision, and indeterminacy), which is generally caused by human simplification of a complex, dynamic, ambiguous, subjective world; and uncertainty (or ambiguity), generally the result of imperfect measurement processes (as discussed in Knowledge Area GD Geospatial Data). Both of these can be manifested in all forms of geographic information, including space, time, attribute, categories, and even existence. Imperfection is also dealt with in Units GD6 Data quality (in the context of measurement), GC8 Uncertainty and GC9 Fuzzy sets (for the handling and propagation of imperfections), and CV4 Graphic representation techniques (in the context of visualization).">

<Unit NameLong="Map use and evaluation" NameShort="CV6" Description="Map use addresses how the user utilizes the map or visualization for map reading, analysis, discovery and interpretation. Map reading is the translation of the graphic or other representation of features into a mental image of the environment. It involves the identification of map symbols and the interpretation of the symbology to understand the geographic phenomena. Map analysis allows the reader to analyze and understand the spatial structure of and relationships among features on a map. Visualizations often allow discovery of unexpected patterns and associations in data sets. Interpretation allows the reader to seek explanations for unusual or interesting patterns on maps. The reader can either look at one map and seek explanations for the patterns observed or look at several maps and seek understanding of the variations (perhaps through time) between the maps. Evaluation leads to better understanding of the user experience with the map or visualization. This unit also examines the impact of uncertainty in the data on the map use and evaluation of the use of the displayed data by the map reader. Technical aspects of uncertainty are covered in more depth in Unit GC8 Uncertainty and Unit GD6 Data quality.">

<KnowledgeArea NameLong="Design Aspects" NameShort="DA" Description="Proper design of geospatial applications, models, and databases, and the validation and verification of design activities, are critical components of work in all areas related to GIS and T. Design failures can negate well-intentioned efforts to apply concepts and technology to solve real-world problems. While sharing a number of concerns with general systems analysis, the unique and complex spatial elements of geospatial information provide significant additional challenges. The focus of this knowledge area is on the design of applications and databases for a particular need. The design of general-purpose models and tools (e.g., raster and vector) is covered in Knowledge Area DM Data Modeling. In the context of specific implementations, design activities fall into three general classes: 1. Application Design addresses the development of workflows, procedures, and customized software tools for using geospatial technologies and methods to accomplish both routine and unique tasks that are inherently geographic. 2. Analytic Model Design incorporates methods for developing effective mathematical and other models of spatial situations and processes. The design of the analytic model is often influenced by decisions that are made about data models and structures. 3. Database Design concerns the optimal organization of the necessary spatial data in a computer environment in order to efficiently sustain a particular application or enterprise. Several units in Knowledge Area GD Geospatial Data follow from Knowledge Area DA Design Aspects, especially those that discuss the collection of data in conformance with the designs discussed herein. This knowledge area is also closely related to Knowledge Area OI Organizational and Institutional Aspects, which discusses several issues relating to the management of systems in organizations after they are designed and implemented. Beyond GIS and T, this knowledge area has strong ties to information science and technology (e.g., Gorgone, G. B. and Gray, P., 2000, and Gorgone, G. B. and others, 2002), and to business management in the area of resource planning. Some of the methods of geospatial system design are identical to established methods in information system design, while others are unique.">
<Unit NameLong="The scope of GIS and T system design" NameShort="DA1" Description="Geospatial applications, such as GIS, consist of data and procedures (automated or manual) that attempt to represent real world phenomena and processes.

<KnowledgeArea NameLong="Data Manipulation" NameShort="DN" Description="GIS is a cyclical rather than a linear system such as computer aided drafting (CAD) and Computer Assisted Cartographic Systems. Changes in projection, grid systems, data forms, and formats take place during the modeling process for which GIS was designed. Many non-analytical manipulations are necessary to accommodate the analytical power of the GIS. The manipulations of spatial and spatio-temporal data involve three general classes of operation:  1. Their transformation into formats that facilitate subsequent analysis,  2. Generalization and aggregation that affect the accuracy and integrity of the data used for analysis, and  3. Transaction management that allows for the tracking of changes, versioning, and updating without loss of the original data.  Practitioners frequently need to make decisions on when and how to engage in data manipulation. The ability to switch between raster and vector systems without substantial information loss is necessary for effective spatial analysis. Furthermore, knowledge of how particular data types respond to changes in format, organization, scale, resolution, and quality is often paramount to the ability to perform modeling and spatial analysis. During data manipulation operations, it is extremely important to know how to handle error propagation, as discussed in Knowledge Area GC Geocomputation Unit GC8 Uncertainty.">
<Unit NameLong="Representation transformation" NameShort="DN1" Description="Other knowledge areas have identified different forms of data structures, data models, projections, and other forms of geospatial data representation.

The raster and vector data models are described in Units DM3 Tesselation data models and DM4 Vector and object data models.The principles of coordinate systems, datums, and projections are also considered in Knowledge Area GD Geospatial Data.">

<KnowledgeArea NameLong="Geocomputation" NameShort="GC" Description="The knowledge area emphasizes the research, development and application of computationally intensive approaches to the study of complex spatial-temporal problems. It is motivated by the fact that some geographical systems can be difficult to model or analyze well when relying on more traditional statistical approaches-due to a combination of data complexity, invalid assumptions and computational demands. Geocomputational methods are often drawn from machine learning and simulation research, and include a variety of methods designed to simulate, model, analyze and visualize a range of highly complex, often non-deterministic, non-linear problems. Methods include, but are not limited to, cellular automata, neural networks, agent based models, genetic algorithms and fuzzy sets. The boundary between Knowledge Areas AM Analytical Methods and GC Geocomputation is blurred as a consequence of their shared goals. As methods evolve within geocomputation, computer science, and GIS and T, units and topics included in Knowledge Area GC Geocomputation today may be more aptly included in Knowledge Area AM Analytical Methods in the future. Curriculum planners should not consider the order in which units are presented to be prescriptive. Furthermore, although much of the content may best be studied within graduate-level programs, fostering awareness of these topics may be appropriate at other levels as well. Mastery of the objectives presented in this knowledge area require knowledge and skills presented in the Computer Science body of knowledge (ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Task Force, 2001).">

<KnowledgeArea NameLong="Geospatial Data" NameShort="GD" Description="Geospatial data represent measurements of the locations and attributes of phenomena at or near Earths surface. Information is data made meaningful in the context of a question or problem. Information is rendered from data by analytical methods. Information quality and value depends to a large extent on the quality and currency of data (though historical data are valuable for many applications). Geospatial data may have spatial, temporal, and attribute (descriptive) components as well as associated metadata. Data may be acquired from primary or secondary data sources. Examples of primary data sources include surveying, remote sensing (including aerial and satellite imaging), the global positioning system (GPS), work logs (e.g., police traffic crash reports), environmental monitoring stations and field surveys. Secondary geospatial or geospatial-temporal data can be acquired by digitizing and scanning analog maps, as well as from other sources, such as governmental agencies.  The legitimacy of geographic information science as a discrete field has been claimed in terms of the unique properties of geospatial data. In a paper in which he coined the term GIScience, Goodchild (1992) identified several such properties, including: 1. Geospatial data represent spatial locations and non-spatial attributes measured at certain times. 2. The Earths surface is highly complex in shape and continuous in extent. 3. Geospatial data tend to be spatially autocorrelated. It has long been said that data account for the largest portion of geospatial project costs. While this maxim remains true for many projects, practitioners and their clients now can reasonably expect certain kinds of data to be freely or cheaply available via the World Wide Web. Federal, state, regional, and local government agencies, as well as commercial geospatial data producers, operate clearinghouses that provide access to geospatial data. The U.S. Geological Survey envisions a National Map that is nationwide in coverage and updated continuously. Although geospatial data are much more abundant now than they were ten years ago, data quality issues persist. Good data are expensive to produce and to maintain. Proprietary interests impede data accessibility, especially beyond the U.S., where the notion of data as a public good is uncommon.  Standards for geospatial data and metadata are useful in facilitating effective search, retrieval, evaluation, integration with existing data, and appropriate uses. National and international organizations such as the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develop and promulgate such standards.">

<KnowledgeArea NameLong="GIS and T and Society" NameShort="GS" Description="Geographic Information Science and Technology exists to serve the society, but it is not a panacea. The history of its development is the sum of fragmented efforts, which have still not been fully integrated. Its potential benefits are often constrained by several factors, and its potential impacts are not fully understood.  Institutional and economic factors limit access to data, technology, and expertise by some of those who need it to make better decisions. Political, ideological, and personal issues aside, organizations invest in GIS and T when estimated benefits outweigh estimated costs. Evaluating costs and benefits is difficult and too often leads to nothing being done, however. For some individuals and groups, costs are prohibitive even though potential benefits are compelling.   The legal framework provides a structure for regulating a number of key aspects of geographic information science, technology, and applications. Legal regimes determine who can claim the exclusive right to hold and use geospatial data, the conditions under which others may have access to the data, and what subsequent uses are permitted. Political struggles arise from conflicting proprietary and public interests about who benefits from geospatial information, and how the power to allocate the use of this information is, or should be, distributed among members of a society. The need to choose among conflicting interests sometimes poses ethical dilemmas for GIS and T professionals. Because so many public agencies and private organizations rely upon GIS and T for planning, decision-making, and management, GIS and T increasingly affects and is used to direct daily life. Critical approaches to understanding the role of GIS in society equip practitioners to employ GIS and T reflectively. The critical approach specifically questions the assumptions and premises that underlie the economic, legal, and political regimes and institutional structures within which GIS and T is implemented. Related concerns are considered in Knowledge Area OI Organizational and Institutional Aspects.">
